# UFTP Transfer Configuration
# Define multiple transfer blocks, each with its own source and destination

transfers:
  # First transfer block: OASIS grid files
  - name: "OASIS Grid Files"
    remote_base: "/work/ab0246/a270092/input/oasis/cy48r1"
    local_dir: "/proj/awi/download/oasis/grids"
    files:
      - "TCO319-D3/1280/grids.nc"
      - "TCO319-D3/1280/masks.nc"
      - "TCO319-D3/1280/areas.nc"
  
  # Second transfer block: Remapping files
  - name: "Remapping Weights"
    remote_base: "/work/ab0246/a270092/input/oasis/cy48r1/TCO319-D3/1280"
    local_dir: "/proj/awi/download/oasis/remap"
    files:
      - "rmp_R320_to_RnfA_GAUSWGT.nc"
      - "rmp_A320_to_feom_GAUSWGT.nc"
      - "rmp_feom_to_R320_GAUSWGT.nc"
  
  # Third transfer block: Model output
  - name: "Model Output Files"
    remote_base: "/work/ab0246/a270092/output/experiment_001"
    local_dir: "/proj/awi/download/exp001"
    files:
      - "atm/data_2020_01.nc"
      - "atm/data_2020_02.nc"
      - "ocn/ocean_2020_01.nc"
      - "ocn/ocean_2020_02.nc"

# Notes:
# - Each transfer block is independent
# - remote_base: Base directory on Levante (absolute path)
# - local_dir: Destination directory on local system (absolute path)
# - files: List of files relative to remote_base
#   (subdirectories in file paths will be created automatically)
# - All files are verified with MD5 checksums after transfer
